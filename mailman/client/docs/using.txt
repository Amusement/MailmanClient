===================
Mailman REST client
===================

This is the official Python bindings for the GNU Mailman REST API.  In order
to talk to Mailman, the engine's REST server must be running.  You begin by
instantiating a client object to access the root of the REST hierarchy,
providing it the base URL, user name and password (for Basic Auth).

    >>> from mailman.client import Client
    >>> client = Client('http://localhost:8001/3.0', 'restadmin', 'restpass')

We can retrieve basic information about the server.

    >>> dump(client.system)
    http_etag: "..."
    mailman_version: GNU Mailman 3.0... (...)
    python_version: ...
    self_link: http://localhost:8001/3.0/system
